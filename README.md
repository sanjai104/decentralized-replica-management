# Decentralized Replica Management in Edge Environments with Latency Optimization

A final-year project focused on **efficient, low-latency, and fault-tolerant replica management** in edge computing environments.

##  Tech Stack
- **Backend:** Java 17, GlassFish Server
- **Database:** MySQL
- **Architecture:** Decentralized Node Monitoring and Decision Engine

## Core Modules
1. **Replica Management** – Efficient creation, deletion, and migration of replicas.
2. **Communication Module** – Ensures node-to-node and server-node communication.
3. **Node Monitoring** – Tracks resource usage, availability, and fault detection.
4. **Decision Engine** – Uses system metrics to optimize replica placement.
